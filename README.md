Archives for HWs,experiments,course projects during my postgraduate period.

###Variational Principle and Finite Element Method(CE013009, Spring 2016)
Course project, lectured by Prof. Shi Zhiyu.  
In this project, I wrote a short program to calculate the displacement and stress for a certain frame with the help of matlab.

###Unsteady Aerodynamics and Separated Flow(F012004, Spring 2016)
Final experiment, lectured by Prof. Lu Zhiliang and Huang Da.  
In this experiment, I calculated the unsteady aerodynamics when the model was in a large scale motion with high rate. The program was based on CGAL.  
The results indicated the hysteresis effect of the unsteady aerodynamics examined in this experiment, and the estimation was consistent with tested data.

###Multi-objective Optimization in Fluid Mechanics(F012005, Spring 2016)
Final project, lectured by Prof. Chen Hongquan.
