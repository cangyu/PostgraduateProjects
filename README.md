## Computational Aerodynamics(CE012002, Autumn 2015)
Course project, lectured by Prof. Xue-qiang Liu and Prof. Jian Xia.  
Simulation of the invisid flow over the NACA0012 airfoil using the Finite Volumn Method are performed.  
12 experiments were done with Mach Number equals 0.3,0.8,1.2 respectively, and the angle of attack(alpha) equals 0,3,6,9 for each Mach case.  
Following table shows the pressure distribution for each case.

Although the legacy program were mainly writen in Fortran, I carried out this project using C++ from scratch and the abstraction is quite clear.  

## Variational Principle and Finite Element Method(CE013009, Spring 2016)
Course project, lectured by Prof. Zhi-yu Shi.  
In this project, I wrote a short program to calculate the displacement and stress for a certain frame with the help of matlab.

## Unsteady Aerodynamics and Separated Flow(F012004, Spring 2016)
Final experiment, lectured by Prof. Zhi-liang Lu and Prof. Da Huang.  
In this experiment, I calculated the unsteady aerodynamics when the model was in a large scale motion with high rate. The program was based on CGAL.  
The results indicated the hysteresis effect of the unsteady aerodynamics examined in this experiment, and the estimation was consistent with tested data.

## Multi-objective Optimization in Fluid Mechanics(F012005, Spring 2016)
Final project, lectured by Prof. Hong-quan Chen.  
The project was consisted of 2 tasks. Firstly, I implemented the Genetic Algorithm(___GA___) to do the optimization of given functions.Secondly, with the principle of nash equilibrium, I implemented the Nash Genetic Algorithm with 2 players to optimize the given function.

The results were illustrated in graphs generated by python. Although the post-processing job was rather tedious, the clear presentation finally produced by LateX was worthwhile.  

## High Precision Methods in Fluid Mechanics(F012010, Spring 2016)
Course project, supervised by Vice-Prof. Jie Wu.  
In this project, I implement the TLLBM(Taylor series and Least Square based Lattice Boltzmann Method) algorithm to simulate the flow passing a cylinder in 2D.  
The TLLBM I used is LBGK-D2Q9,which is very typical among its counterparts, and I gave out 4 groups of results where Re equals 20,40,100 and 200 respectively.The simulation results show out the Karman Vortex Street clearly, which is identical to experimental results when Re is not large.

The Streamlines and Vorticity contours were generated by Tecplot,but I was not in favour of this software. Instead, I wrote 2 short python scripts to generate the convergence curves.
