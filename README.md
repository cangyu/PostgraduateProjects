Archives for HWs,experiments,course projects and other projects during my postgraduate period.

###Variational Principle and FEM
Course project for Variational Principle and Finite Element Method(CE013009) lectured by Prof. Shi Zhiyu.  
In this project, I wrote a short program to calculate the displacement and stress for a certain frame with the help of matlab.

###Unsteady Aerodynamics and Separated Flow
Final experiment for Unsteady Aerodynamics and Separated Flow(F012004) lectured by Prof. Lu Zhiliang & Prof. Huang Da.  
In this experiment, I calculated the unsteady aerodynamics when the model was in a large scale motion with high rate. The program was based on CGAL.  
The results indicated the hysteresis effect of the unsteady aerodynamics examined in this experiment, and the estimation was consistent with tested data.
